# Creospan's eBay Scraper

## Introduction
Creospan's eBay Scraper is a powerful tool that simplifies the process of scraping eBay product listings. Built using Python, this application can be run locally or deployed as a web app. The scraper searches for kitchen appliances on eBay and exports the collected data to a CSV file. With an easy-to-use web interface, users can download the CSV containing the data, making it convenient for further analysis or processing.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
To run the eBay Scraper locally, you will need:

Python 3.8 or higher
pip (Python package installer)

## Installation
Clone the GitHub repository or download the source code as a ZIP file:
git clone https://github.com/your_username/ebay_scraper.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd ebay_scraper

## Running the Scraper
